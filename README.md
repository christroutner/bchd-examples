# bchd-examples

These are simple examples showing how to use the [grpc-bchrpc-node](https://github.com/simpleledgerinc/grpc-bchrpc-node) [npm library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc-bchrpc-node) to interact with a BCHD node. It also uses [bch-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chris.troutner/bch-js) from [FullStack.cash](https://fullstack.cash) to do some data manipulation.

## Install
These examples have been tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with Node.js LTS v12.16.1

- `git clone https://github.com/christroutner/bchd-examples && cd bchd-examples`
- `npm install`
- `cd get-raw-transaction`
- `npm start`

Each sub-directory is a stand-alone app. Enter the directory and run `npm start` to run that example.
